Chat Bot Project

This is a simple chat bot project that allows users to communicate with a chat bot (roobex) via a web interface.

+Project Structure

The project is divided into two main folders:

client: This folder contains the front-end code for the chat bot web interface. It was built with React and makes requests to the server via a REST API.
server: This folder contains the back-end code for the chat bot server. It was built with Node.js, core and Express and provides a REST API for the client to communicate with.
